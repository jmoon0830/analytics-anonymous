TLDR

  One of our assumptions going into this was that companies that had a more online presence would have a better chance of seeing growth in the market due to the lack of human interaction. Because of this, we pointed out technology as the sector that should see the most growth. While this is true that the technology sector is one of the leading sectors for 2020, we also see that the real estate sector is tied with technology for a 7.7 ROC over the 2 quarters so far in 2020. 
	While these two sectors are the biggest cases of doing better than the predicted ROC, all the of the sectors that were studied show to do significantly better, or worse in the case of Health Care, than what was predicted based on past performance. 
	One trend that all of the sectors do share is that there is a v-shaped recovery after falling in the first quarter of the year. This is an economic term where a market has started to come up after a previous fall, looking like a v on a graph. 

	Going through the project, one of our biggest problem was trying to figure out which data to use to properly show each sector. Not all stocks are equal in terms of price or volume sold, so we had to find a statistic that would let us compare them equally. 
	Going through the results we clearly see some interesting things that we werenâ€™t expecting, so with more time we would have wanted to look more into what was happening in certain sectors to allow them have more success than others. We would also want to compare
