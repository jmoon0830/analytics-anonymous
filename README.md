# Pandemic Stock Analysis

Summary:

Our team wanted to analyze stock data during the pandemic (COVID-19). We wanted to see the differences in growth between the sectors. Our data was sourced from AlphaVantage and we used Python to extract, clean, and transform the data as well as make our visualizations.

Things to Note:
- We made our analysis based off of historical data and made a linear regression to predict the average rate of growth for 2020.
- We used January 2020 to June 2020 as our pandemic dates and compared that period to historical data.

Assumptions:

One of our assumptions going into this was that companies that had a more online presence would have a better chance of seeing growth in the market due to the lack of human interaction. Because of this, we pointed out technology as the sector that should see the most growth.

Findings:
- While the technnology did have a large growth, we also see that the real estate sector is tied with technology for a 7.7 ROC over the 2 quarters so far in 2020.
- In fact, all the of the sectors that were studied show to do significantly better, or worse in the case of Health Care, than what was predicted based on past performance.  
- One trend that all of the sectors do share is that there is a v-shaped recovery after falling in the first quarter of the year. This is an economic term where a market has started to come up after a previous fall, looking like a v on a graph. 
  
 Methods:
 - Extract and Transform Data
 - Data Visualizations
 - Linear Regression Model
 
 Technologies:
 - Python (Pandas,Jupyter Notebook)
 
Aftermath:

Going through the project, one of our biggest problem was trying to figure out which data to use to properly show each sector. Not all stocks are equal in terms of price or volume sold, so we had to find a statistic that would let us compare them equally. We clearly see some interesting things that we werenâ€™t expecting, so with more time we would have wanted to look more into what was happening in certain sectors to allow them have more success than others.
